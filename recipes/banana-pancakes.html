<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>

    <li>Milk</li>
    <li>Baking Powder</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Salt</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder) in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) in another bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
<li>Pour the batter in Â¼ cup portions onto a lightly oiled pan or griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Cook for a few minutes, flip with a spatula, and cook for another few minutes (or until each side is golden brown).</li>
<li>Serve your banana pancakes immediately. They're delicious alone or with your favorite pancake toppings.</li>
